  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>Hello! My name is Lucas Waunn and this is my first submission for this ITMD-361, Fundamentals of Web Development course! A few things about me are:</p>
  <p>• I am currently on the IIT baseball team</p>
  <p>• I have red hair</p>
  <p>• I have tried and failed at making my own website many times (so hopefully this course gives me a good understanding at what I have been doing wrong)</p>
  <p> I hope to learn a lot in this course and I am super excited to get started!</p>
